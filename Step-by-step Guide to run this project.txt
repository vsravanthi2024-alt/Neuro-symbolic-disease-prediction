Step 3: Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Open Command Prompt / Terminal inside the project folder.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

* **Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Linux / macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Step 5: Prepare the Dataset

1. Place the dataset files inside the `data/` folder.
2. Ensure the dataset format matches the description provided in the repository.
3. Run preprocessing (if provided):

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

This step cleans and prepares the data automatically.

Step 6: Run the Model

To start training the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

* The model will begin training.
* Progress will be displayed in the terminal.
* Trained models are saved automatically.


Step 7: Evaluate the Model

After training, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This generates:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

Results are saved in the `results/` folder.

Step 8: Generate Figures and Tables (Optional)

To reproduce figures and tables used in the paper:

```bash
python generate_results.py
```

Step 9: View Outputs

* **Models** → `models/`
* **Results** → `results/`
* **Figures** → `figures/`

Notes for Users

* No code modification is required to run the project.
* Default settings are sufficient for reproduction.
* Random seeds are fixed to ensure reproducibility.
