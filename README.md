# Neuro-symbolic disease prediction
This repository contains the implementation of a framework that combines neural and symbolic reasoning components using an attention-based fusion mechanism, enabling effective linkage between unstructured clinical narratives and structured medical knowledge. This design supports interpretable and reliable clinical decision-support modeling.
# Project Title
Neuro-Symbolic Disease Prediction Framework

## Description
This repository contains a neuro-symbolic framework for disease prediction using emulated electronic medical records (EMRs). The approach integrates structured medical knowledge with contextual language representations to support interpretable clinical modeling.

## Dataset Information
- Type: Electronic Health Records/ clinical records
- Content: Symptom-level textual descriptions and associated labels
- Availability: Kaggle Repository
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidvictor297/electronic-medical-records-emr

## Dataset Organization
The dataset used in this study is a self-curated synthetic dataset designed to emulate clinical records. The data are organized into separate directories for input samples and corresponding labels to support reproducible experimentation.
## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized to reflect the data processing pipeline. Raw EMR data are stored separately from processed text and extracted symptom representations to support reproducibility.
